									<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">RMI Intership</h2>
									<p><i>June &ndash; July 2025</i></p>
									<p>
										During my internship at the Royal Meteorological Institute (RMI) in Brussels,
										I worked on a project focused on the calibration and monitoring of precipitation radars.
										The main objective was to develop a software tool that automates the calibration process,
										thereby ensuring accurate and reliable radar measurements.
										<br/>
										Producing precise radar measurements is a key requirement
										for improving downstream meteorological products,
										such as quantitative precipitation estimates and weather forecasting models.
										My role involved designing and implementing data processing algorithms,
										developing a user-friendly interface, and preparing the integration of the tool
										into RMI’s existing operational systems. While full integration could not be completed
										within the timeframe of the internship, it is planned for my return to the institute,
										where I will continue and finalize this work.
										<br/>
										In addition to the main project, I developed an auxiliary radar image
										visualization tool to support analysis and facilitate daily work,
										improving both efficiency and data interpretation.
										This internship allowed me to apply my technical skills
										in a real-world operational environment, while deepening my understanding
										of meteorological instrumentation and data analysis.

									<h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Météo-France intership</h2>
									<p><i>April &ndash; July 2024</i></p>
									<p>
										I also completed an internship at Météo-France,
										where I developed a tool for the intercomparison of two precipitation radars.
										The objective was to assess the consistency and performance of radar measurements
										by analyzing and comparing their outputs.
										<br/>
										The tool was implemented as an automated script,
										without a graphical user interface,
										and was designed to be run manually for specific case studies.
										Despite its initial standalone usage,
										the tool is currently being integrated into the operational radar monitoring chain,
										highlighting its relevance and reliability for long-term use.
										<br/>
										As part of this project, I designed and improved a BUFR binary file decoder,
										rebuilding it from scratch to ensure robustness, flexibility,
										and better adaptability to the radar data formats in use.
										This work significantly strengthened my skills in low-level data handling,
										binary formats, and data processing pipelines,
										while deepening my understanding of meteorological observation systems.

									<h2>CAn7 website</h2>
									<p>
										As part of my role as secretary of the CAn7 audiovisual association,
										I am leading the redesign and update of the association’s website.
										Based on an HTML5UP template, I am rebuilding the site from scratch
										while preserving the overall look and identity of the previous version.
										<br/>
										I am enhancing the project by integrating Astro to improve structure,
										maintainability, and performance. The website is automatically deployed using GitLab Pages,
										with a CI/CD pipeline based on GitLab CI, ensuring reliable and reproducible builds.
										This ongoing project allows me to further develop my skills in modern web development,
										version control, and deployment automation, while modernizing an existing system
										without altering its original spirit.

							<h2>Personal Professional Project</h2>
							<p>
								I aim to pursue a career in the public sector, within scientific
								and technical organizations serving the public interest.
								The field of meteorology is of particular interest to me:

							<h2>International</h2>
							<p>
								As part of my engineering degree, I am required to complete 17 weeks abroad,
								an experience that I view as a key opportunity for both professional and personal development.
								In addition to this academic requirement, I have already had the chance to take part
								in several international trips.
							</p>
							<h3>Uccle, Belgium (2025)</h3>
							<p>
								<span class="image left"><img src="images/uccle.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								During the summer of 2025, I completed an internship at the Royal Meteorological Institute in Brussels,
								where I worked on the calibration and monitoring of precipitation radars.
								I was part of a small, diverse team of about fifteen people from various countries,
								including Germany, Ukraine, Peru, and the Netherlands.
								The multilingual environment required me to communicate primarily in English,
								which helped me develop my adaptability and collaborative skills.
								<br/>
								The internship was also personally enriching. I explored Belgium, visiting cities such as Brussels,
								Namur, and Bruges, and learned to navigate independently in a new environment.
								I enjoyed the experience so much that I will be returning next year to complete
								the 17-week international internship requirement, further deepening my professional experience
								and cultural exposure.
							</p>
							<hr/>
							<h3>Barcelona, Spain (2024)</h3>
							<p>
								<span class="image left"><img src="images/barcelone.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								Between my preparatory program and engineering school,
								I spent one week in Barcelona with friends.
								This trip was both an opportunity to recharge after an intensive academic period
								and a chance to discover a new culture, meet new people, and explore unfamiliar landscapes.
								<br/>
								Although physically demanding, the experience was extremely rewarding.
								We explored the city extensively, visiting its iconic architectural landmarks and vibrant streets,
								and, of course, enjoying its beaches as well.
							</p>
							<hr/>
							<h3>Trip in Europe (2019)</h3>
							<p>
								At the age of 14, I took part in a two-week summer camp in Europe.
								During this experience, we traveled through four major cities in four different countries:
								Berlin (Germany), Vienna (Austria), Prague (Czech Republic), and Venice (Italy).
								<br/>
								Moving from one culture to another in such a short time was initially disorienting,
								but ultimately very enriching. This experience helped me develop cultural openness,
								adaptability, and curiosity at an early age.
